# 📁 EC7212 – Computer Vision and Image Processing - Take Home 01


## 🧪 Requirements

Before running the programs, make sure to install the required libraries:

pip install opencv-python numpy




## 📄 Contents

`Q01.py`           |
    Reduces the number of intensity levels in a grayscale image to a power of 2 (e.g., 2, 4, 8, ..., 256).

`Q02.py`                    
    Applies spatial averaging (mean filtering) using 3×3, 10×10, and 20×20 kernels, and compares the results.

`Q03.py`                      
    Rotates an image by 45° and 90° and displays the results in a grid layout.

`@04.py`
    Simulates spatial resolution reduction by replacing non-overlapping 3×3, 5×5, and 7×7 blocks with their average pixel value.

## 📷 How to Run

Run each script in the terminal or any Python IDE:

python script_name.py


When prompted, provide the full path to the image you want to process.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

Through these programs, you will learn:

- Image reading, conversion to grayscale, and visualization.
- Pixel-level manipulation and block-wise processing.
- Image filtering using averaging (mean) kernels.
- Geometric transformations like rotation.
- How spatial resolution affects image quality.
